It provides points of orientation towards teaching that champions students' agency, competencies and well-being, as set out in the <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">OECD Learning Compass</a>. By guiding and empowering teachers, we guide and empower learners. And by investing in both, we invest in shaping the future we want – for education, for society and for the planet.</p>
                <p>Together, the Teaching Compass and the Learning Compass form a guiding roadmap for the future of education, drawing on a globally informed yet locally adaptable vision. This aspirational framework is grounded in both robust and emerging research, and enriched through international collaboration, dialogue and co-creation among the OECD Future of Education and Skills project's diverse group of stakeholders.</p>

            <p>In an age defined by complexity, transformation and uncertainty, the role of the teacher is more vital than ever. As the world asks students to become agents of creative, resilient and collaborative change, the same must be true for their teachers. The OECD Teaching Compass is a bold and timely response to this call. It seeks not only to support teachers, but to reimagine the profession itself, empowering educators to thrive in the 21st century and shape the future of learning.</p>
            <p>The Teaching Compass was inspired directly by the OECD Learning Compass 2030. As this vision for student learning took shape, it became increasingly clear that such transformative learning could not be realised without corresponding changes in teaching practice and in the support systems that sustain teachers. In other words, students will only flourish when their teachers are equally empowered in terms of their professional identity, agency, competencies and well-being.</p>

            <!-- A New Narrative -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-12 mb-4">A new narrative for the teaching profession</h3>
            <p>At the time of writing, education systems around the world are responding to rapid change and growing complexity. Global teacher shortages, widespread stress and burnout, and rapid technological shifts, including the rise of AI, have dramatically reshaped the teaching landscape. Yet these challenges also present a unique opportunity to reimagine teaching as a dynamic, adaptive and collaborative profession.</p>
            
            <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg shadow-sm">
                <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-900 mb-3">The Teaching Compass seizes this opportunity, offering a transformative perspective that:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>anchors</strong> professional identity, dignity and integrity.</li>
                    <li><strong>centres</strong> teacher agency as a driving force.</li>
                    <li><strong>elevates</strong> competencies beyond subject knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>ensures</strong> teacher well-being as essential to sustainable education.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-12 mb-4">Why the Teaching Compass now?</h3>
            <p>Teachers face a growing list of expectations – to deliver curriculum, nurture well-being, adapt to digital and AI-assisted learning, support inclusion, and build critical 21st-century competencies. Yet they are often left without the tools, recognition or systemic support to succeed. The Teaching Compass addresses this gap with a coherent and actionable framework. It provides the vision and direction needed to align teaching practices with broader educational goals both globally and locally.</p>

            <p>The OECD Learning Compass outlines a clear vision for education focused on individual, collective and environmental well-being. These three intertwined dimensions form a holistic educational approach essential for sustainable development, preparing individuals to contribute positively to society and the environment. These goals remain central to the OECD Teaching Compass as well.</p>
